# Purpose

---

This is a PID controlled 1D-helicopter project inspired by a lecturer at Cornell University named Hunter Adams. The
circuit design and other materials can be found [here](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Helicopter/Helicopter.html), but
a notable difference is that this project was completed entirely in python with the Raspberry Pi Pico.
